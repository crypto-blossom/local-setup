= Manual setup on local machine

== Prerequisites
If youâ€™re on macOS, install Homebrew and https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup.sh[macos-setup.sh] script to setup all necessary tools.

If you are not on macOS or you don't have Homebrew, you need to install:

- Go compiler, at least 1.14
- Geth (Ethereum client) 1.9.9-stable
- Solidity, at least 0.5.17
- Protobuf compiler, at least 3.11.4
- `protoc-gen-gogoslick` toolchain
- `jq`

Regardless you use `macos-setup.sh` or not, you should also install:

- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker[Docker] & https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose]
- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv], at least 1.2.18 (optional - only if testnet relay is used)
- https://github.com/pypa/pipenv[pipenv], at least 2018.11.26 (optional - only if testnet relay is used)

== Node.js version notice

Please use Node `v12.18.3` for everything but E2E test script.
To run the test script, please use Node `v14.3.0`.

We recommend using https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm] to manage node versions easily.
You can install both versions by doing:
```
nvm install 11.15.0
nvm install 14.3.0
```
And use the specific version:
```
nvm use 11.15.0
nvm use 14.3.0
```

On macOS, you can also use `brew install node@12` to install Node 12, and use
`brew link --force node@12` to make it your default local install.

== Installing the system
. Initialize local `geth` using:
+
```
./initialize-geth.sh
```
+
You can skip this step if your local geth is already initialized. This script clears all Ethereum client data, initilizes genesis block, and funds five accounts. All client data are kept in the working directory of this project so all the data used for other projects stay untouched.

. Run local `geth` node using:
+
```
./run-geth.sh
```
. Run local Bitcoin Core node and ElectrumX using:
+
```
./run-bitcoin.sh
```
. Run Keep & tBTC installation script:
+
```
./install.sh
```
+
This script will fetch `keep-core`, `keep-ecdsa`, and `tbtc` source code, deploy contracts of `keep-core`, `keep-ecdsa`, and `tbtc`. It will also build `keep-core` and `keep-ecdsa` off-chain clients.
+
Later on, if you decide to update `tbtc`, you can run just `install-tbtc.sh`.
+
Keep in mind, `tbtc` depends on `keep-ecdsa` and `keep-ecdsa` depends on `keep-core` so if you decide to update `keep-ecdsa`, you can run `install-keep-ecdsa.sh` followed by `install-tbtc.sh`.
+
If you decide to update `keep-core`, you have to run `install-keep-core.sh` followed by `install-keep-ecdsa.sh` followed by `install-tbtc.sh` or just the entire `install.sh` again.

== Run clients
The above installation script will configure:

- 1 `keep-core` client
- 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients

To run the `keep-core` client use:
```
./run-core-1.sh
```

It is enough to run one `keep-core` client to generate a group and produce relay entries. Setting up more than one client locally is possible but consumes more resources.

To run `keep-ecdsa` clients use:
```
./run-ecdsa-1.sh
```
```
./run-ecdsa-2.sh
```
```
./run-ecdsa-3.sh
```

There are at least 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients needed to open a keep. Setting up more than three clients locally is possible but consumes more resources.

== Beacon genesis

Before the beacon is able to produce a first relay entry, genesis needs to happen. Genesis triggers the first random beacon group selection.

Genesis should be triggered after `keep-core` client started with:
```
cd keep-core
KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD="password" ./keep-core --config configs/config.local.1.toml relay genesis
```

Bonded ECDSA keep factory from `keep-ecdsa` contracts requests for new relay entry to reseed after each signer selection but it is also possible to request for a new relay entry manually with:
```
cd keep-core
KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD="password" ./keep-core --config configs/config.local.1.toml relay request
```

== How to interact with the system

You can interact with the system through the tBTC dApp or automated
end-to-end tests. Before you start interacting, make sure you:

- Installed all system components using `install.sh` script
- Have a local Geth instance (`run-geth.sh`) working
- Have local Bitcoin Core and ElectrumX instances (`run-bitcoin.sh`) working
- Have 1 `keep-core` and 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients up and running

=== Keep Dashboard dApp

To run the Keep Dashboard dApp invoke:
```
./run-keep-dashboard.sh
```

=== tBTC dApp

To run the tBTC dApp against the local Bitcoin network,
make sure the tBTC dApp is configured to work with the local ElectrumX instance.
You can configure this in `./tbtc-dapp/src/wrappers/web3.js` file,
where `TBTC.withConfig` line occurs. Change it as follows:
```
const tbtc = await TBTC.withConfig({
    web3: web3,
    bitcoinNetwork: BitcoinHelpers.Network.REGTEST,
    electrum: {
        server: "127.0.0.1",
        port: 50003,
        protocol: "ws"
    }
})
```

Then, you can invoke:
```
./run-tbtc-dapp.sh
```
The application will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.

=== E2E tests

To run the automated end-to-end scenario switch to Node 14.3.0:
```
nvm use 14.3.0
```
Then invoke:
```
./run-e2e-test.sh
```
